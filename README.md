#### <font color='purple'>SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) codes are a type of notation used to represent molecular structure in a simple text-based format. They are commonly used in cheminformatics and computational chemistry to represent chemical compounds in a machine-readable format.</font> 

#### <font color='purple'> A SMILES code is a string of letters, digits, and symbols that describes the atoms, bonds, and connectivity of a molecule. The atoms are represented by their chemical symbols (e.g., C for carbon, N for nitrogen, O for oxygen) and are connected by bond symbols (e.g., - for single bond, = for double bond, # for triple bond). Additional symbols are used to represent aromatic atoms, chiral centers, and other features of the molecule.</font> 

#### For example, the SMILES code for water is "O" and the SMILES code for ethanol is "CCO". These codes can be used to generate 2D and 3D molecular structures.

#### <font color='purple'>SMILES codes are useful for storing, searching, and comparing molecular structures in databases, and for performing virtual screening and molecular docking studies. They are also used in various applications such as drug discovery, chemical analysis, and materials science.</font>
